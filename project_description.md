## Project: Creating Customer Segments

## Project Overview
In this project I will apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. I will first explore the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, I will preprocess the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, I will apply PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I will compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.

## Project Highlights
- How to apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
- How to interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
- How to analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
- How to optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
- How to assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.
